---++ Motivations 

This is a clone of Foswiki:Extensions.TablePlugin enabling skinning through abstraction of CSS class name via skin templates using Foswiki:Extensions.CssPlugin.
The original idea was to make the table format totally skinnable using skin template thus the plug-in name. However full skinability would require dramatic changes to the plug-in logic and possibly loss of funtionality.
We eventually decided to make minial changes to simply enable variable CSS class name in the hope that those changes get integrated in Foswiki:Extensions.TablePlugin at some point.
